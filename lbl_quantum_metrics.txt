Questions:
How do you display KL/Shannon divergence? Some sort of average, or every result individually?
Why do different circuits with very similar Hilbert-Schmidt and Trace distances have very different KL Divergences?
    Is there something obvious with the matrices?
How much difference numerically do you need to move the KL divergence around?
Can you predict divergence based on distance?

Tasks:
Data with many states for KL etc
KL divergence may not be great with some types of gates; maybe use TVD?
Matrix of top and bottom of KL columns
